                Around this time of year, Stoike Island would always be freezing, that made Sam wear a black leather jacket she stole randomly from Berry’s over her dirty white tank top. She looked paler than she was. That, and the fact that she was wearing her pj’s combined with her shortly cut pale blond hair, made her seem identical to a homeless hippy. At least it would make her unnoticeable, she thought to herself. Not that she wasn’t considered one already.<br />
                She hid her hands in the pockets of her jacket. It seems as if the blood in her veins had frozen. Her perky nose was rose red. And if it wasn’t cold already, it was freezing on top of John the barbers, rooftop and unfortunately that was where she was.<br />
                “Stealing those gloves doesn’t seem like that poor of an idea now”, she mumbled to herself watching over the dimly lit street.<br />
                It was almost midnight now. That and the fact that John’s shop was outside the town near the west-side beach, meant it was a dead street. The street lamps had an alien green tint to them visible through the thick fog. Small rays of moonlight through the occasional clouds lit her face once in a while, highlighting her hazel-green eyes.<br />
                “Damn these kids, I am going to become a snowman here waiting for those idiots to show up.” She complained. The statement itself was pretty ironic considering the fact that she herself was technically a 13-year-old.<br />
                She was now beginning to think that her fathers’ vision might be wrong, although considering the past record of that, it seemed pretty unlikely. The whole atmosphere of the night, even the cold was somehow oddly calming. Her head felt like it was underwater, it felt light and heavy at the same time.<br />
                If it wasn’t for the footsteps and her ear's amazing range, she would be found on top of a barber shop like a frozen fish. At least that would make for an interesting headline she thought. “TOO MUCH COLD, NOT ENOUGH CLOTHES’”. But, then again, she’d really be surprised if they even knew she existed.<br />
                Not wasting her precious time on her foolish thoughts, she stood up and leaped headfirst down the roof feeling fear, excitement filled her brain as the unforgivingly cold night hit her face and ended with satisfaction as she rolled her entire body precisely at the right movement to prevent any damage the impact might’ve had. Countless times she failed to prevent or even decrease the damage of her falls; this was the most perfect fall she had ever had. This made her grin and lightened her anger a little.<br />
                She sprinted into the wood to hide herself and get a closer look at what the threat might be. But all she could see through the trees were the two boys walking down the road. Nothing about it was unnatural aside from the time, which should be mid-night by now. They were trailing towards the beach it seemed and would quickly be out of her sight. Her hopes to find some meaning out of her father’s new visions seemed to be crumbling every moment now. Until she heard the sound of leaves behind her crumble and an unforgiving wind hit back, sending shivers down her whole body. Whatever it was, wasn’t just a wild animal for sure was now too close to her she could feel it having a huge body. All her body was ready to swirl and defend herself.<br />
                How did this happen? How was she not able to hear this thing? Every second that passed felt like an eternity to her…<br /><br />
                -------<br /><br /><br />

                “We should return our butts back home before anyone notices, you hear me Joe” Mike whispered while trying to keep up with Joe. Even walking was an awfully tiring task for someone of his weight compared to his frail friend but now, they were almost running on their heels now.<br />
                “Mike, they won’t let us search for him in the morning, you know that.” Joe replied with a bit of anger in his voice. “What worse than that could they do to us…”<br />
                “They wouldn’t even have now if they knew we were” Mike said while huffing. “And I can’t say for yours but, mine mother is going to have me hung up by my feet if she knew”<br />
                “It has been three days!” Joe’s feet suddenly came to an abrupt stop as he faced his friend who barely stopped in time to not collide with him headfirst. “If you think that the old fat Turner is going to find Dan than you should never have stepped out of that window in the first place”<br />
                Mike was standing there just stunned by the display of anger from his red-faced friend. Compared to Mike, he looked like a little enraged child. He was always a small one, he thought. ‘Angry Goblin’ was what those jerks back at school used to call him due to his height and curly brown hairs. Yet he also was very fierce and brave. Braver than anyone he knew, if not the most intelligent one. A quality for which Mike had always respected him knowingly, as it was the one, he clearly lacked.<br />
                “I am not going back” Mike said trying his best to look serious in this cold. “Not until you are with me”<br />
                “Then stop complaining or we are going to freeze before our return…” Joe replied and turned around towards the beach but before he could walk, Mike caught him by his arm.<br />
                “Hey!” Joe complained. “I told you if you wanna…”<br />
                Mike shushed him.<br />
                “Someone’s in the woods” Mike whispered pointing his finger towards the dark dense woods on the right of the road.<br />
                Both of them were now silent, listening carefully. Whatever sound he heard in those woods now seemed to have turned into idle night noises. It was terrifyingly silent now and it was making this situation intolerable for Mike.<br />
                “Don’t look there, just get up and head back towards our home’s and hope that none of our parents knew that we went out”<br />
                “What if it's Dan in there!”<br />
                “JOE!” Mike shook him similar to how people shake bottles of soda just to watch it explode. “Listen to yourself! Why would Dan be out there in these woods at midnight instead of his own bed”<br />
                Joe did not reply. He looked fazed.<br />
                “Look we’ve got no time to argue. If you are not moving, I am more than willing to you back to your home”<br />
                However, before he could do any of that a blindingly bright purple light from the sky filled the night. Both boy’s attention drifted toward the cause. It was so bright it looked like a star on steroids and colorful drugs in the night sky.<br />
                “Is that shooting star…” Said Mike whose attention was now fixed towards the source of light.<br />
                “Is it expanding…” Joe said, also looking at it.<br />
                It wasn’t.<br />
                It was some sort of degree having a yellow tail behind it that had caught a purplish fire, while entering the planet's orbit. It was moving at a rapid pace.<br />
                Both boys were now dazed by the beautiful spectator that was in their bluish sky lighting the greenish clouds purple as it went through them leaving a yellow trail of smoke behind it.<br />
                “Not a skeptical anyone except us and a few bits of overworked employees with night shifts could be enjoying this island.” Mike whispered, drawing a large chunk of cold night breath of night air inside. It was an oddly satisfying and sorrowful moment. “Daisy would’ve loved to see this”<br />
                “Yah, you bet.” Joe said, his eyes were fixed on the sky but his mind wasn’t there. In the past perhaps. His face was unreadable. “I wish Dan too was here”<br />
                And just like that as if the universe was eavesdropping, exploded itself into colors as the meteor struck the water of the beach they were standing on, animating the dull lifeless water into chaos and dyeing it with a bizarre greenish glow. Unfortunately for those kids it woke more than just the night…<br /><br />
                -------<br /><br /><br />


                Turner was having a knock-out, one of the best naps he had ever had on his night sift. Until (because it is now a known rule in the head of his that him having a nice, peaceful nap is automatically prohibited by the world) the whole world and the rusty old tele on his desk had a seizure, almost knocking him out of his chair. His knees made it hard for him to stand-up with an indication of clearly heard cracking sounds. These years of life were holding him down, he thought. His vision was blurry and he suddenly felt a chill down his spine from the freezing atmosphere of the room. He aimlessly moved his hands on his table searching for his glasses, knocking a glass bottle, which shattered the moment it touched the ground leaving a wet and glass sprinkled floor.<br />
                “God damn it! Was that the Lizzy’s one” He said finally finding his glasses and putting them on. “She would kill…”<br />
                He suddenly stopped in his tracks. The tele had now fallen silent. He finally realizing that it wasn’t what was wrong this time, but everything was wrong. The door to Police station and the one that went to cells was open resulting in chilling atmosphere. His hand as an involuntary to the response to the situation went straight to his left pant pocket, where he usually kept his keys. No matter how much he wished for it to be there, it wasn’t. He just stood there listening to the sound of… well nothing. Nothing his except ringing in his ears. Then suddenly the tele rang again. He felt as if he had been standing in nothingness and someone just hammered him back to reality.<br />
                “Gimme a break!” he exploded, picking the tele up so furiously that he might have ripped the cord and it would’ve been great. But it never happened. “Who is it and what is it?! Spill it out quickly. And I dare you that it should not be old Joe reaching havoc down town on his bloody bull!”<br />
                “It’s me, John. Were you sleeping, again?” said the person on the tele.<br />
                “What would ya’ except from an old timer. I need some break”<br />
                “Yaah and don’t worry about it wasn’t Joe this time. It’s something else… We aren’t sure what it is but…”<br />
                “What?”<br />
                “Hey! give it to me!” someone else yelled on line.<br />
                “Is it?”<br />
                “Hey, it’s me Sheriff.”<br />
                “Lizzy! What in the world are you doing there? Give that phone back to that bastar-.”<br />

                “There’s no time for this. There is going to be a meteor that strike near our West-side area.”<br />
                “I don’t know about any of that young girl. All I know is the fact that your mother is going to kill me an-.”<br />
                “Don’t worry about it. She will never find out.”<br />
                “How did you even get with that idiot?!”<br />
                “Umm, we are almost there. Will talk to you latter, bye and don’t tell mo-” She said all that in one breath.<br />
                “Hey! Don’t cut I need to talk to hi-” The line was cut and was just beep-beep now.<br />
                “God damn it!” He slammed the tele hard.<br />
                “Kids! They got no respect. All that knowledge but no control!” Which gave an impression that he was muttering to the all-seeing Japanese toy cat with a creepy smile on his desk overflowing with useless stuff. Then he slowly turned around to face the slightly open rusty door with a little rectangular bared mouth on the top center that went to the cells which were the they had been, empty. Except the one that had been occupied by a soul last night and was mocking him, was the proof that he was getting too old for this. Behind which he saw nothing but an eternal darkness, dark enough to give his eyes a hard time when he turned the other way around to face the open door to adjust to the bright yellow light from the lamp above the door that also was open. Betrayer, he thought, letting out that unknown man and letting in that unforgivingly cold winds.<br />
                When he thought that the winds once again entered through the door. Those cold winds carried the salty refreshing sent of the sea and the creatures that lies beneath but along with it came the unforgiveness of sea, the feeling of your mouth, ears and nose feeling with water and your body and mind slowly drowning. Slowly closing your eyes to sleep a never-ending sleep.<br />
                Those winds struck him hard: passing through his uniform to touch his warn skin sucking the moisture out of it than entering it, in the process his skin tightening itself around his hairs making them stand underneath the layer of clothing stand and finally reaching his core, sending a tingle down his spine, shaking him to his very core. As a reaction to this freezing temperature both his arms covered his chest.<br />
                The dark combined with the cold had turned the tuna he ate for dinner turn back alive in his stomach. He picked his gun belt from his desk and moved closer to the front door. Step by step, carrying an unexplainable fear in his heart weighing him down, until the cold night air brushed against his face, once again. He took in a huge chunk of the nights air inside his lungs. Surprisingly it burned his throat but, made him feel significantly powerful somehow.<br />
                “Gotta find that strange talking fella, now.” He swallowed. “He was an interesting, sure. But, people! They don’t appreciate a hot place these days! Of course, they like to stay in freezin place than a hot stay of hospitality at police”
                With that he took a step forward into the darkness…<br /><br />
                -------<br /><br /><br />

                Even from within the layer of her thick leather jacket Sam could feel the cold tip of gun pushed against her back. Her feet were plastered to the ground and her body as rigid as frozen concrete. Her whole body underneath the layer of clothing was sweating. Fear had gotten her good. She is still just a child; she thought no matter her extensive training she still fears. Her brain was going silent and a sensation of having your whole body covered with ants was how her skin felt.<br />
                But amongst the silence she still could hear the voices of the boys arguing. This is your mission; you have to get your shit together! She closed her eyes; remember. She slowed her breathing counting every breath that went inside her.<br />
                She opened her bright hazel eyes.<br />
                “Listen kid-” The unseen man with gun started.<br />
                But before he could finish anything, she jolted her left hand backward towards him, getting a good hold on right gun wielding arm, using it to rotate her body in swirling motion close to him, coiling her right arm around the his same one and then using the momentum and the weight of his own body to strike him down to the ground; completing a successful judo fall.<br />
                All through this process her face was decorated with an enjoying grin which disappeared the moment she saw the sharp tip of a large needle- no a sword, a needle like sword, centimeters away from her face. Once again, she stood dead in her tracks; defeated again. But now she got a good at the man; a tall man who was slim but still had muscle, visible underneath his attire an old ragged white shirt, which considering the was a death warrant to yourself. His face was long, with long chin covered, small eyes, a long and slim nose, lips the shade color of his sandy skin that seemed to be always grinning and small facial pointy black facial hairs. His hairs were a long black curly hot mess; you could say it was similar to a bird’s nest. And Sam was staring at this man straight into his blue eyes. He would be 30 or 40, she thought. It was hard to have a clear guess of his age.<br />
                “Quite a good sport aren’t ya, lad” He said in a thick English accent while standing up, even keeping the tip of his sword fixed to the point where it was, in the progress. “Now you seem like an intelligent and powerful lad, but I mean to you no harm. It is just direction, I want.”<br />
                She didn’t reply just kept staring at him with angry eyes.<br />
                “Where is the port of this land located?” He asked.<br />
                “Don’t know”<br />
                “Don’t know?”<br />
                “I am not from here”<br />
                “Neither am I”<br />

                Joe, was a tough guy. Or so he believed until that DAY. But of course, he was a tough guy as every other retired military person would be. And he had to be, considering the times he lived in. Leaving the big city of Deni not finding work enough to feed his stomach a complete meal. It was tough times for the people of once big and proud country, PIir. A drift in seasons and an unpredictable apocalyptic weather, combined with a list of diseases found in the recent years threw Plir down from the throne of pride and glory it once occupied. Joe was just an old timer caught up in the wars of people he never knew. For him it never ended. The war. Even years after its supposable end, he still was moving from one battleground to another. It wasn’t about enemies or country back then, neither was it now. It was all about survival. Survival of the fittest, that was the motto of his life.<br />
                He was sitting in his rusty old faded red chevvy pickup windows down, hands out, traveling from one town to another across the country with the little he had saved in recent years. Looking for a job. He would eventually stop by at one of them, tried find a good motel to get some sleep. He never got a good sleep, not after the war happened. He knew he would eventually run out of money. He knew he needed to settle. So, he made a promise to himself, not to go any further, that he would settle at what ever the next town will be. He drove and he drove, across the dead country side of dull orange grey colors. Colors of death were the same in his mind. A dying country; he thought, taking in the last few breaths it had left.<br />
                Even though he had a long way to go and sun wasn’t waiting for him, he would still stop by when ever he saw an alive or uncut tree, which wasn’t very often. In his heart those were old friends, from a different world that he once lived in. Now wasn’t he living, just traveling and not getting anywhere and so were they. He wasn’t a human but a wanderer.<br />
                It was night now and all he could see was a foot of road that went ahead him lit by his pickup’s headlights, one of them was broken. Thought his travels it was just him, the occasional towns and the roads, he never saw any other cars pass by. His vision was now getting a bit blurry and his head felt as if it was submerged underwater, enabling him to focus clearly on the road.  He had been driving for about a whole day without a break now.<br />
                He tried to think to stop his brain from taking him to the afterlife. He thought of a paradise. A paradise that was once told to him existed but, he never believed. It was Han, who told him that he heard from someone a rumor, “Far north of the country, there are still land left. Lands that are alive. Lands that still have green everywhere. Lands hidden. Lands beyond.”. It was during the war that Han had said those words, world still was different back then. But he still didn’t believe him. A world so perfect is a dream and the people that believe in it needs to wake up, he clearly remembered that was what he had said back then. No matter what his pal told him, he never believed in that idea. Still there was a hopeful part of him that did, but he buried it deep within his heart because he was afraid of it and he couldn’t kill that idea. And then Han died. He died beside him, taking a bullet to his heart in the war. Now that he thought, he never got to moron for his death. He never cried for him. He never got the chance because when he died Joe was busy trying to survive. And he still was. But no, his eyes filled with tears. Tears of the memory of his friend; the friend that wanted to give him a hand of hope. But he refused. Those tears weren’t made of water, those were the tears made of regret; regret of a life that he never got to live.<br />
                As his eyes were buried in his past, he was unable to see the person in the present standing on the road in front of him. The one that his car hit. His senses became fully aware the moment his car struck the body of the person, he saw blood splatter across his windshield, the sound of bones shattering under the wheels of the pickup and it going rolling across the road as a result. He was aware of all that but was no part of it. He felt like watching it from a strange corner of his brain and not being able to influence any of it. He was not more than a mere person sitting in a theatre watching a movie and then with a blink of an eye it ended; the screen turned black.<br />

                The day that he fell into this world, was the same day; this world was cursed. Even though he remembered nothing of his life accompanying that day; the day itself had a vivid mark burned into his brain. And why had it not, it was his first memory into this world and his first to enter his brain; devoid of information. It was a little too vivid. So much so that it still hurt his brain remembering the emptiness he had at that time he had felt.
                Light as a feather falling from the sky.
                Ralph opened his eyes. The traffic light now was green and that caused the man in the red Pontiac behind to have a seizure.
                “Shut up!!” He yelled looking tired and stepped on the gas of his rusty-ole cream minivan.
                “Still having those dreams, huh?” Jim asked looking out of the window”
                Ralph grunted and passed the slow taxi in front. He turned around the corner. Jim now was looking straight at his face.
                “You look dirty” He commented.
                “Those big rats had formed a cult down there” He said “They were real nasty”
                “When are they not” he replied. “Even the normal sized ones at subway are huge”
                “Scums of the earth, you know” He added looking at Jim.
                “You need to describe them to me; I’ve not updated the journal in like forever” He said. “Also, about the ghost that talked shit to that lady”
                “Well, about that.” He said rubbing the sandpaper beard he had grown. “There wasn’t any ghost”
                “What?”
                “Well, yah she wasn’t the brightest” He said, turning a sharp corner. “And we could really use that money for deeds better, such as feeding ourselves a good and full meal”
                Their car came to a halting stop as another light went red in their way.
                He looked at Jim; skinny, curly brown hair and round glasses masking his deep blue eyes. He was your average teenager that just turned 14 and had to deal with those nasty hormones. Only except he didn’t look annoyed like he usually did, he looked sad. Perhaps because of hearing of that old crack I had to lie to in order to sew his pocket hole.
                Perhaps he just wasn’t old enough. He himself might not have been in this world for long but he was an adult and he had an adult brain; always thinking of the survival and more importantly survival of those around you. Moreover, the world wasn’t for faint of the hearts but he still didn’t want Jim to know that. He wanted him to enjoy that bubble as long as it could; knowing one day it will bust eventually. No hurries.
                Jim looked toward him.
                “It’s green” he said.
                Ralph blinked, looked ahead and rubbed his eyes.
                “Move your garbage out of the way!” Some person yelled from behind them.
                At that moment Ralph wanted to get off and have the mans face punched; for being perfectly reasonable. But it was just too much effort from his side ad he always wanted it to be minimum. So instead he just sighed and moved on. His eye’s dead stare supported by the darkness underneath them were focused on the road now. His unexplored past lost from his brain made it hard for him to get a little or hardly any sleep.
                “You can really use some coffee right now” Jim asked, his gaze fixed upon Ralph. “We can grab it on our way, huh? What you say?”
                “Believe me boy its coffee that I want right now right now but I don’t think we can” He replied, lazily blinking again after a long time. “That fella on the line sounded desperate”
                Jim did not respond for a while.
                “He said there isn’t police involved right”
                “Yaah he did…” He said. “We are close”
                Jim shifted his gaze from the window towards the street.
                “Hmm” He replied.
                “You packed everything, right?” Ralph asked. “Those new bullets, axe, blades, swords…”
                “Yes, I did” He said now looking a little annoyed.
                “Great” Ralph even though was tired but was never enough to smile at annoyed Jim.
                Ralphs eyes focused on something across the streets as he parked the car on the sideway. His bow frowned.
                “Jimmy, you Gotta sit here” he said. “I think we might have a little problem on our hands”
                Jim also noticed what was wrong and his body tensed. “Why are police there?”
                “I don’t know but I don’t think we can help the man anymore” Ralph replied.
                “What! But we ought to”
                “We are ought to do nothing anymore”
                “But…”
                “You sit here and I will be back in a minute” He said and got out of the car into the windy damp weather of the day. His long black coat and hairs blew backwards. His body got chills as the cold wind contacted his skin. He brushed his and moved towards the block he was called for help; of course, which now he could not provide. It wasn’t far, he could see two police cars in front of the apartment whose second floor was on fire and black smoke rose from it, which was lit occasionally red and blue by the police car. It was all sad for Ralph as this job would have been a good source of income considering its scale; if just there wasn’t the sore sight of those police cars. The weather too didn’t help his mood it was too damp and cold for his taste and the dense brown clouds up ahead provided little light.
